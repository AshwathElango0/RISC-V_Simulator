# RISC-V_Simulator
Contains the source code for an in-terminal RISC-V simulator.

# Project Description
The simulator lets the user load in RISC-V code files(in .s or .txt form), and allows for complete execution, line-by-line execution, insertion of breakpoints, etc.
Errors in code are identified and explained to the user.
Registers and memory are simulated, along with a cache whose architecture is configurable.
Cache statistics such as hit rate and miss rate are also calculated.
